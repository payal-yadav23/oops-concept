## 💡 What You'll Learn

The four pillars of OOP that help build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications:

### 🔐 1. Encapsulation
- Wraps data (variables) and behavior (methods) together in a single class.
- Enhances data security and prevents unauthorized access.

### 👨‍👩‍👧 2. Inheritance
- Enables one class to inherit fields and methods from another.
- Promotes reusability and hierarchical classification.

### 🎭 3. Polymorphism
- Allows methods to behave differently based on context.
- Implemented via **method overloading** (compile-time) and **method overriding** (runtime).

### 🧩 4. Abstraction
- Hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.
- Achieved through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
